# RSA-Algorithm
An  implementation of RSA encryption algorithm in Python using GMPY2 module

## Step-1: Install GMPY2:

Install GMPY2 using the following commands:

`sudo apt-get install libmpc-dev`

`sudo apt-get install python-pip`

`pip3 install gmpy2`

## Step-2: Get very large prime numbers:

Use the following command from `openssl` to generate very large prime numbers:

`openssl prime -generate -bits 2048`

Change the number of bits to get prime number of preferred size.

## Step-3: Run the code:

Run the code by either downloading the file or coping the code and follow the on-screen instructions.

The output is shown below:

**PS**: You can also get prime numbers from here: [List of prime numbers up to 1 000 000 000 000 (1000 billion)](http://compoasso.free.fr/primelistweb/page/prime/liste_online_en.php "List of prime numbers up to 1 000 000 000 000 (1000 billion)")
